Hey friend! I want you to make my dream game ;)
I want a sun with a face to fly around the screen. The sun burns water droplets!
The water droplets then evaporate and fly up to the top of the screen.
If 50 water droplets evaporate, then clouds form, and it starts to rain!
Then you decide what happens.
